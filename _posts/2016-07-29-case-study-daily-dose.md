  For a couple years now I wanted to design a motivational/quote type of app
  based on Pirkei Avot - Ethics of our Fathers, a phenomenal read with countless
  gems. I envisioned getting a notification once a day with a little excerpt
  from the Chapters and probably a question or something at the end to get you
  to think about the quote or something to focus on during your day.
