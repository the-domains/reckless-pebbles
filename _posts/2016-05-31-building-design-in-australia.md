  I have a personal connection with this community centre and when I heard that
  they are rebuilding from scratch I wanted to contribute in my own way. What
  started with a small idea and a couple sketches turned into about half a year
  of work in which myself together with two friends from Tel Aviv designed a
  concept building and 3D rendering of a project that would house everything
  this centre would need for its grown and expansion for the next 20 years. I'm
  very proud of the work we achieved, had a blast doing it and I look forward to
  seeing a building going up in Australia if our design gets chosen.

I actually had the privilege of putting in some design work three years ago when I was in Peru, and there in now a building going up that has a little bit of my touch! </p></article>
