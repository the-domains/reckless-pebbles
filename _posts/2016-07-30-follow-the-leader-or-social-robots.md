# Follow the Leader | Social Robots

We are working on a novel way for robots to gain social skills in order to be able to localise themselves and their team in the world around them. The robots' goal is to correctly choose a leader that optimise their ability to preform different tasks.

If you have a path and you want to send a couple agents there to go check it out, you only need to specify coordinates and they dynamically, among themselves, decide which robot is best to follow and any time they get better data from another one they can all decide as a group to turn around and move in the correct direction as a coordinated pack.
