# MetaKeyboard | The first AR Keyboard
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0762e409-6e9b-4dc9-a267-aac07e48ef02.jpg)

I was given the privilege of leading the project of the MetaKeyboard. This is a virtual, full keyboard that is viewed through the MetaGlasses; the keyboard app gives the ability to type anywhere without the restriction of limited space or computer availability.

My responsibilities included: coding it up, designing the keys, performing research on the history of the keyboard and acknowledging the differences between keyboards (as input paradigm changes, design changes), managing 19 WPM typing in mid air, and negotiating with a leading smartphone keyboard to implement their prediction dictionary and API into our augmented world.
