# MetaSky | The Weather Naturally​

Looking down at your smartphone and opening up a weather app is not the most pleasant or easiest way of finding out such important information like whether you should wear that coat or leave it at home! We found a better way!

Say you wanted to fly to New York tomorrow and needed to decide what to pack, the entire sky, as you looked up, would morph into what millions of New Yorkers are seeing right at this very moment. Even simulating the snow engulfing their beautiful city!

This was a project I started at the very beginning of my time with Meta. I coded up the virtual world using Unity and C\#. Then, together with the Lead Software Engineer we worked on bringing in real world data and made it work in real time. This was also a very interesting project as we discovered how the user reacts and controls information that is supposed to be at a further distance than they could normally reach with their hands. This is something that has never been explored with the 2D computer screen or the smarthphones in our pockets.
