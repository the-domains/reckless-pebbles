  Hand gestures are all the rage nowadays, but we set out to find a newer, more
  natural interaction, we were attempting to find a novel way of controlling

  also wanted to move away from having to constantly jerk your hands around in
  front of you and poke and prod in the air the whole time.

# ReticleGesture | Control your AR world

Hand gestures are all the rage nowadays, but we set out to find a newer, more natural interaction, we were attempting to find a novel way of controlling your computer without the old 2D input systems, the keyboard and mouse. We also wanted to move away from having to constantly jerk your hands around in front of you and poke and prod in the air the whole time.

With this monumental task ahead of us, I went ahead and prototyped a new system that fused together your eye positions and your hand data to become more aware of what the user was actually trying to achieve. I coded this up in Unity3D using just the RGB-D data as we have no eye tracking on our glasses. I then worked closely together with the software team to reconsider how to approach our apps using this new approach. We worked together with a big car manufacturer, and created some designs that are awesome and feel really natural.
