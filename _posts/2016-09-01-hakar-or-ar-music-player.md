  Transportation cards around the world have largely moved from paper tickets to

  However filling up these cards still requires big bulky machines in the

  left and what kind of tickets are stored on your card.

## Concept | Rav Kav Concept App

Transportation cards around the world have largely moved from paper tickets to smart cards that can be filled with money and scanned on the bus or train. However filling up these cards still requires big bulky machines in the station or on the actual tram. So too with checking how much money you have left and what kind of tickets are stored on your card.

These are really annoying problems and no different to what we have in Israel with the Rav Kav system. So as a side project I presented myself with a challenge.

What would it look like if Rav Kav themselves designed the best smartphone app that allows you to do everything from having the card stored on your phone, to having your profile, filling up your account staight from PayPal, ordering new tickets and seeing how much time you have left on this trip.

## HakAR | AR Music Player​

This was my latest project, created during the Israel Tech Challenge Hackathon @ Google Campus in Tel Aviv. Together with my team, Noah Santacruz, Joe Shayani and Meghan Lahmi, we created an Augmented Reality (AR) music player that lived in the 3D and controlled it using unique interactions. Having a virtual music box sitting on your desk playing songs with the sound coming from that box is just way cool!

What was most interesting about this project was that we got the chance to redefine an app that is widely used and well known, to transform from the 2D world it normally lived and move to the 3D world, where we think it just naturally integrates. We designed a novel mode based system and had the transition work based on how much interaction you wanted with your music at any given time.

## Building Design in Australia

I've always been in love with architecture, although it's always come in second place to technology, I still dabble a little bit in building and interior design. I actually had the privilege of putting in some design work three years ago when I was in Peru, and there in now a building going up that has a little bit of my touch!

I have a personal connection with this community centre and when I heard that they are rebuilding from scratch I wanted to contribute in my own way. What started with a small idea and a couple sketches turned into about half a year of work in which myself together with two friends from Tel Aviv designed a concept building and 3D rendering of a project that would house everything this centre would need for its grown and expansion for the next 20 years. I'm very proud of the work we achieved, had a blast doing it and I look forward to seeing a building going up in Australia if our design gets chosen.

## Follow the Leader | Social Robots​

We are working on a novel way for robots to gain social skills in order to be able to localise themselves and their team in the world around them. The robots' goal is to correctly choose a leader that optimise their ability to preform different tasks.

If you have a path and you want to send a couple agents there to go check it out, you only need to specify coordinates and they dynamically, among themselves, decide which robot is best to follow and any time they get better data from another one they can all decide as a group to turn around and move in the correct direction as a coordinated pack.

## ReticleGesture | Control your AR world

Hand gestures are all the rage nowadays, but we set out to find a newer, more natural interaction, we were attempting to find a novel way of controlling your computer without the old 2D input systems, the keyboard and mouse. We also wanted to move away from having to constantly jerk your hands around in front of you and poke and prod in the air the whole time.

With this monumental task ahead of us, I went ahead and prototyped a new system that fused together your eye positions and your hand data to become more aware of what the user was actually trying to achieve. I coded this up in Unity3D using just the RGB-D data as we have no eye tracking on our glasses. I then worked closely together with the software team to reconsider how to approach our apps using this new approach. We worked together with a big car manufacturer, and created some designs that are awesome and feel really natural.

## MetaKeyboard | The first AR Keyboard
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8046a37d-2095-467e-84da-5dbf89c825dd.jpg)

I was given the privilege of leading the project of the MetaKeyboard. This is a virtual, full keyboard that is viewed through the MetaGlasses; the keyboard app gives the ability to type anywhere without the restriction of limited space or computer availability.

My responsibilities included: coding it up, designing the keys, performing research on the history of the keyboard and acknowledging the differences between keyboards (as input paradigm changes, design changes), managing 19 WPM typing in mid air, and negotiating with a leading smartphone keyboard to implement their prediction dictionary and API into our augmented world.

## MetaSky | The Weather Naturally​

Looking down at your smartphone and opening up a weather app is not the most pleasant or easiest way of finding out such important information like whether you should wear that coat or leave it at home! We found a better way!

Say you wanted to fly to New York tomorrow and needed to decide what to pack, the entire sky, as you looked up, would morph into what millions of New Yorkers are seeing right at this very moment. Even simulating the snow engulfing their beautiful city!

This was a project I started at the very beginning of my time with Meta. I coded up the virtual world using Unity and C\#. Then, together with the Lead Software Engineer we worked on bringing in real world data and made it work in real time. This was also a very interesting project as we discovered how the user reacts and controls information that is supposed to be at a further distance than they could normally reach with their hands. This is something that has never been explored with the 2D computer screen or the smartphones in our pockets.
