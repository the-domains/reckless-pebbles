  This was my latest project, created during the Israel Tech Challenge Hackathon
  @ Google Campus in Tel Aviv. Together with my team, Noah Santacruz, Joe
  Shayani and Meghan Lahmi, we created an Augmented Reality (AR) music player
  that lived in the 3D and controlled it using unique interactions. Having a
  virtual music box sitting on your desk playing songs with the sound coming
  from that box is just way cool!

# HakAR | AR Music Player​

This was my latest project, created during the Israel Tech Challenge Hackathon @ Google Campus in Tel Aviv. Together with my team, Noah Santacruz, Joe Shayani and Meghan Lahmi, we created an Augmented Reality (AR) music player that lived in the 3D and controlled it using unique interactions. Having a virtual music box sitting on your desk playing songs with the sound coming from that box is just way cool!

What was most interesting about this project was that we got the chance to redefine an app that is widely used and well known, to transform from the 2D world it normally lived and move to the 3D world, where we think it just naturally integrates. We designed a novel mode based system and had the transition work based on how much interaction you wanted with your music at any given time.

# Building Design in Australia

I've always been in love with architecture, although it's always come in second place to technology, I still dabble a little bit in building and interior design. I actually had the privilege of putting in some design work three years ago when I was in Peru, and there in now a building going up that has a little bit of my touch!

I have a personal connection with this community centre and when I heard that they are rebuilding from scratch I wanted to contribute in my own way. What started with a small idea and a couple sketches turned into about half a year of work in which myself together with two friends from Tel Aviv designed a concept building and 3D rendering of a project that would house everything this centre would need for its grown and expansion for the next 20 years. I'm very proud of the work we achieved, had a blast doing it and I look forward to seeing a building going up in Australia if our design gets chosen.
