  Have you ever thought about how crazy and unbelievingly overwhelming the
  future is -- how we can create things that are beyond our wildest imaginations
  that will change the world and become common place one day? Well, I have. I
  love everything about the future: the sheer uncertainty, the immense
  possibilities and the fact that it is all ours. I like to spend my time
  figuring out everything on nanotechnology, cryptography, space exploration,
  other worldly philosophy, robotics, transhumanism, and how to design the
  perfect car. If any of these interest you, I would love to chat.
